# **End-to-End Stock Data Handling and Prediction Project**  

## **Overview**  
This project demonstrates a complete data pipeline for handling stock data. It starts by taking user input for a stock ticker through a **Streamlit** web application, fetching historical data from **Yahoo Finance (yfinance)**, storing it in a **MySQL database**, and then applying machine learning and natural language processing for insights.  

Key features include:  
1. **Historical Data Handling**: Downloading and storing stock data in a database.  
2. **Price Prediction**: Using **XGBoost** to predict the next day’s stock price.  
3. **Recommendation System**: Leveraging a **Large Language Model (LLM)** to provide a textual recommendation on the selected stock ticker.

## **Features**  
- **Streamlit UI**: An interactive and user-friendly interface for entering stock tickers.  
- **Data Retrieval**: Automated data fetching using **yfinance**.  
- **Database Integration**: Storing data in **MySQL** for structured storage and analysis.  
- **Machine Learning**: Next-day price prediction using **XGBoost**.  
- **LLM-Based Analysis**: Contextual insights and recommendations generated by a Large Language Model.

## **Technologies Used**  
- **Frontend**: [Streamlit](https://streamlit.io/)  
- **Data Retrieval**: [yfinance](https://pypi.org/project/yfinance/)  
- **Database**: [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/)  
- **Machine Learning**: [XGBoost](https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/)  
- **Natural Language Processing**: [Ollama](https://ollama.com/) -> [llama3.2 1B model](https://ai.meta.com/blog/meta-llama-3-1/)

## **How It Works**  
1. **User Input**:  
   - The user enters a stock ticker symbol (e.g., AAPL, MSFT) in the Streamlit application.  

2. **Data Fetching**:  
   - The application fetches historical stock data for the entered ticker from **Yahoo Finance**.  

3. **Price Prediction**:  
   - **XGBoost** is used to analyze historical data and predict the stock's next-day price.  

4. **Recommendation**:  
   - The application queries an **LLM** to generate a recommendation or insight about the stock based on the retrieved data.  

5. **Data Storage**:  
   - Retrieved data is stored in a **MySQL database** for further analysis and persistence.

## **Setup Instructions**  

Just copy paste the below :)

```bash  
git clone https://github.com/GovindTV/End-to-End-Data-Handling-Project.git  
cd End-to-End-Data-Handling-Project  
docker-compose up --build -d
docker exec -it end-to-end-data-handling-project-ollama-1 ollama run llama3.2:1b  
\bye

```  
## **Future Enhancements**  
- More SQL queries
- ~~Store db creds safely in .env file and update the script to use it.~~
- Use AI as a data transformation layer.
- Dockerization for easier sharing.
- Deployment of the application on a cloud platform (e.g., AWS, Azure, GCP).
